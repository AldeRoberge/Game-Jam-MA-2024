## The Star of Nourry-Andona

Mada can no longer play on his frozen consoles, Vitalen can’t open his frozen books, Lifex can’t play his frozen instruments, and Almidéphi is desperately trying to free his cat trapped in a block of ice.

One evening, over a beer, an old sage tells them a legend: at the top of the highest mountain shines the Northern Star. Its light grants the dream of whoever touches it.

Determined to change their fate, the four friends set out on a quest. But only one can reach the star. Who among them will triumph?
